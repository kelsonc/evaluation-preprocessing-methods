This repository contains complementary materials for the article Evaluating the Impact of Data Preprocessing Techniques on the Performance of Intrusion Detection Systems.

The article studies the impact of data processing techniques on the performance of Machine Learning (ML) based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

The preprocessing techniques used were data cleaning, codification, and normalization to observe performance in binary and multiclass models.

The datasets used were UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017, which are publicly available.

The main objective of the work lies in the research questions aimed at which data processing techniques perform best in Machine Learning based IDS and how various classification algorithms perform under different preprocessing techniques.
